//------------three ways of declaring any variable ---------------

var myName = "Prathamesh" //var for entire codebase can be used

let ourName = "freeCodeCamp"    //let used for a particular scope

const pi = 3.14   //const used for declaring any constant value, cannot change its value further in entire codebase


// can skip semi-colon, but advised to use after the line completes


//-------------checking values of various variables at various points in code base------------------
var a   //declaring the variable
console.log(a);
var a  = 2;  //assigning the variable

console.log(a);  //to see it in console

var c = "I am a ";
console.log(c);
c = c + "String";     //concat strings : +
console.log(c);


//all vars are case-sensitive


var product = 2.1 * 2.1;
console.log(product);
